# Steps to install SASS on Windows

1. Opened terminal and navigated to the 0x03-sass_scss directory.
2. Verified that Node.js and npm are installed using: node -v and npm -v
3. Installed SASS locally using:
   - npm install sass@3.7.4
   (If version 3.7.4 failed, installed latest using: npm install sass)
4. Confirmed the installation using:
   - npx sass --version
